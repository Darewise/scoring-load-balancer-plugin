<div>
<p>
Calculates a score of a node depending on the result of the last build
at which the target project ran on that node.
</p>
<p>
The score for the node is calculated by multiplying scale and result score.
See followings for details.
</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <th>score of node</th>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>(scale) * (result score)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>scale</th>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>(Scale for Scores) + (adjust score)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>scale</th>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>(Scale Adjustment for Older Builds) * (# of builds from the last build)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>result score</th>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>(Score for Success/Unstable/Failure Build)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
For exmaple, consider following configurations:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td>Scale for Scores</td>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Scale Adjustment for Older Builds</td>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>-1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Score for Success Build</td>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Score for Failure Build</td>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>-1</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
With a project with following builds:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <th>Build #</th>
  <th>Result</th>
  <th>Node</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>#20</td>
  <td>Failure</td>
  <td>node1<br />
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>#19</td>
  <td>Failure</td>
  <td>node2<br />
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>#18</td>
  <td>Success</td>
  <td>node1<br />
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>#17</td>
  <td>Success</td>
  <td>node3<br />
</tr>
</table>
<p>
This results in following scores for nodes.
</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <th>node1:</th>
  <td>-10</td>
  <td>(for Failure in #20)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>node2:</th>
  <td>-9</td>
  <td>(for Failure in #19)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>node3:</th>
  <td>7</td>
  <td>(for Succeed in #17)</td>
</tr>
</table>
